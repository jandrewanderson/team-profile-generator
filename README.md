## Installation

Simply download the file from my github repo. After that, open the terminal for the folder that you copied from my repo. Once the terminal is open, type npm install. This will allow you to have all of the necessary packages to run my program (ie. Inquirer and Jest). 

## Usage

Open the terminal in this folder. Type node index.js to begin the prompt. Go through all of the questions for each section that you would like to add content for in the HTML file that you are creating for your team. Once complete you should have an HTML file that includes a card for yourself and each of your employees. Eacg card will display all necessary information for the employee.

If you have other Questions you can refer to the video or refer to my GitHub profile.
