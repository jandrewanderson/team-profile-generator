# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a program using node.js to allow the user to easily create a professional README file. This project utilizes the prompt method to allow the user to input their responses and have those responses automatically populate the README file in the appropriate section.

I have a number of folders in my repo. Classes contains the classes that I used for the project. This is ultimatley what contained all of the data from the responses. Test is what runs the test on the classes to make sure that they are pulling the correct data. The index.js file is what actually begins the command line prompt and creates the HTML file. The temaplate.html file is simply the file that I used to make everything go where I wanted it to and look the way I wanted it when the user actually creates the team. I also have an example of the product created from the command line prompt.

## Installation

Simply download the file from my github repo. After that, open the terminal for the folder that you copied from my repo. Once the terminal is open, type npm install. This will allow you to have all of the necessary packages to run my program (ie. Inquirer and Jest). 

## Usage

Open the terminal in this folder. Type node index.js to begin the prompt. Go through all of the questions for each section that you would like to add content for in the HTML file that you are creating for your team. Once complete you should have an HTML file that includes a card for yourself and each of your employees. Eacg card will display all necessary information for the employee.

If you have other Questions you can refer to the video or refer to my GitHub profile.
